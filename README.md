# National-Agrifunds-Hackathon

## Submission Instruction:
  1. Fork this repository
  2. Create a folder with your Team Name
  3. Upload all the code and necessary files in the created folder
  4. Upload a **README.md** file in your folder with the below mentioned informations.
  5. Generate a Pull Request with your Team Name. (Example: submission-XYZ_team)

## README.md must consist of the following information:

## Tech Stack: 
React Native: To build mobile appplication that work on both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase.

Java: To implementing offline transactions that allow users to perform transactions even when they are not connected to the internet.

Python: Creating a machine learning model for crop recommendation involves using data-driven techniques to suggest the most suitable crops.

Rest API:  To fetch and retrieve weather-related data from external sources. for weather analysis.

## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  Step 1:Run the given files in VS Code . 
  
  Step 2:After successful execution , a QR will be displayed .
  
  step 3:Scan that QR using Expo go(a mobile application to be installed) and you can see that the app is opening with a login page.
  
  Step 4:Then you can access all the features in our application and see how it works.
  
## What I Learned:
  Initially while creating the prototype , we have learnt how to use react native to develop cross-platform mobile applications for farmers. We also gain more knowledge in Python by performing data analysis for the feature crop recommendation and in rest api to integrate external data source . Also we have learnt how to handle and debug errors and also how to test our application by using Expo and other tools
